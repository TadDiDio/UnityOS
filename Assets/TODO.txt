ROSLYN:
Check attributes on bad types, i.e. Subcommand only allowed on ICommand objects
Check that positional indexes are different
UnlimitedArgsAttribute is only used on IEnumerable fields
Only one UnlimitedArgsAttribute
Required is only for switch, all positional are always required
Making a switch with the same long or short name
Missing Command attribute on command class
preserve attribute for anything with Command on it

THINGS TO TEST

NEXT UP:
hierarichal help command (help command subcommand)
Precommand validators
aysnc commands (minimal additional work, testing mostly) 
input redirection (to current terminal application, possibly working but untested) 
permissions system (hooked via precommand validator)
windowing system for multiple terminals or custom windowed commands
Maintain consistency per environment (editor, build), not across both
multi console state tracking via files
Auto completion system with rich typed positional arg hints in CLI

BUGS
Weird error case: unexpected token appearing after positionals but before a switch on a command which accepts variadic 
args may display a required validation error despite having the switch because the unexpected token started the 
variadic processing. Technically this error is correct but its unclear.


FEATURES TO GET TO
Allow users to apply/override global command name and description processing for consistency
Allow command groups for better output in reg command
Allow users to register type parsers in a single spot if they prefer, something like GlobalTypeParserRegistration.
Create auto test harness to allow users to quickly test their commands.
Async command discovery process removes the need for manual registration which would be absolutely attrocious
Pipe unity log to console
unified vs per shell log
reset terminal command which resets console state to default if a user fucks it

NOTES FOR DOCS
Commands are stored in registry using their fully qualified name i.e. parent.sub.subsub so that multiple subcommands 
can have the same root name without conflicts. Make sure to use the fully qualified name if doing a query (users will
very rarely if ever need to query though)

COMMAND IDEAS
bind
list (debugs helpful fields on all types in the scene maybe)
